## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**queenjt/Queenjt** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating a magic mirror.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning java through college.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on my magic mirror project.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning to be a better coder.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about nothing just yet, as I am very new to this.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: shoot me a message here.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: My job has nothing to do with coding, but I think it's cool so I am learning it for fun.
